# packages

- @vue/compiler-sfc: This package contains lower level utilities that you can use if you are writing a plugin/transform for a bundler or module system that compiles Vue Single File Components(SFCs) into JavaScript.

- vue-server-renderer: This package offers Node.js server-side rendering for Vue 2.0.

- vue-template-compiler: This package can be used to pre-compile Vue 2.0 templates into render functions to avoid runtime-compilation overhead and CSP restrictions. In most cases you should be using it with vue-loader, you will only need it seperately if you are writing build tools with very specific needs.
